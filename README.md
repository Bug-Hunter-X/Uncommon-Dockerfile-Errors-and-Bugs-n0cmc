This repository showcases a few uncommon issues that can arise in Dockerfiles, particularly related to image selection, dependency management, and command execution.  The `Dockerfile` contains the problematic code, and `Dockerfile_solution` provides a corrected version with explanations.  Improper Dockerfile construction can lead to build failures, runtime errors, and security vulnerabilities. This example highlights best practices for more robust and reliable Docker images.
